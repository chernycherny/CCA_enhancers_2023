Integrative Multi-Omics Enhancer Activity Profiling Identifies Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Cholangiocarcinoma of Different Etiologies

This project contains source codes for this paper. The source codes are not meant to be run from start to finish. It won't work because:
1. The data files are not included here (please download and process the data files as required, see Data Availability in the paper)
2. The source codes are cobbled together from various codes written in the course of this project
3. The source codes are far from "production-ready" code. They are at R&D stage and are written ad-hoc to accomplish research objectives.

Instead, the source codes are provided only as reference / documentation of how we performed the analysis in this project. You may refer to this code should you want to write your own program to reproduce our results!
