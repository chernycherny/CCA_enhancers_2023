This directory contains analysis_cca_enhancers_meth_upload.Rmd, which is an R script containing code for methylation data processing and analysis. 

The R script is not meant to be run from start to finish. It won't work because:
1. The directory doesn't include the various required data files (please download and process the data files as required, see Data Availability in the paper)
2. The script is cobbled together from various R scripts written in the course of this project

Instead, the R script is provided only as a reference / documentation of how we performed the analysis in this project. You may refer to this script should you want to write your own program to reproduce our results!
